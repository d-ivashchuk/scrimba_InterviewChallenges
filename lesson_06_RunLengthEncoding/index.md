## Task

Implement `encode` and `decode` functions that follow run length encoding pattern. Run-length encoding is a form of data compression, where consecutive data elements are replaced by just one data value and count of that value.

## Example

```js
console.log(encode('wwwiiuuuu')) // 3w2i4u
console.log(decode('2u3a4o')) // uuaaaoooo 
```
